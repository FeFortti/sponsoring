## The SatRday philosophy

#### Open, and Open source 

Everybody can organise a SatRday as long as it follows these requirements: 


+ The main event must happen on a __Saturday__

+ The event must operate under a __Code of Conduct__ and have a __strong commitment to increasing the diversity of speakers and attendees__

+ The ticket price to attend the Saturday for an industry person must __cost less than 8 hours of minimum wage work__

+ The event has a __pot of free tickets available for people who can’t afford__ the full cost

+ Speakers should not be required to pay the attendance fee

+ There should be a __mechanism to encourage and mentor new speakers__

+ The event should be __volunteer run__

+ __Excess funds should support the local community__ whether that’s the user group, holding the funds over for your next satRday, or arranging a big name speaker to come do a workshop during the next year
